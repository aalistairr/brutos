/// A soft limit on the amount of references that may be made to an `Arc`.
///
/// Going above this limit will abort your program (although not
/// necessarily) at _exactly_ `MAX_REFCOUNT + 1` references.
const MAX_REFCOUNT: usize = (isize::MAX) as usize;

/// A thread-safe reference-counting pointer. 'Arc' stands for 'Atomically
/// Reference Counted'.
///
/// The type `Arc<T, A>` provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
/// allocated in the heap. Invoking [`clone`][clone] on `Arc` produces
/// a new `Arc` instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the
/// source `Arc`, while increasing a reference count. When the last `Arc`
/// pointer to a given allocation is destroyed, the value stored in that allocation (often
/// referred to as "inner value") is also dropped.
///
/// Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and `Arc` is no
/// exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to something
/// inside an `Arc`. If you need to mutate through an `Arc`, use
/// [`Mutex`][mutex], [`RwLock`][rwlock], or one of the [`Atomic`][atomic]
/// types.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Unlike [`Rc<T>`], `Arc<T, A>` uses atomic operations for its reference
/// counting. This means that it is thread-safe. The disadvantage is that
/// atomic operations are more expensive than ordinary memory accesses. If you
/// are not sharing reference-counted allocations between threads, consider using
/// [`Rc<T>`] for lower overhead. [`Rc<T>`] is a safe default, because the
/// compiler will catch any attempt to send an [`Rc<T>`] between threads.
/// However, a library might choose `Arc<T, A>` in order to give library consumers
/// more flexibility.
///
/// `Arc<T, A>` will implement [`Send`] and [`Sync`] as long as the `T` implements
/// [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. Why can't you put a non-thread-safe type `T` in an
/// `Arc<T, A>` to make it thread-safe? This may be a bit counter-intuitive at
/// first: after all, isn't the point of `Arc<T, A>` thread safety? The key is
/// this: `Arc<T, A>` makes it thread safe to have multiple ownership of the same
/// data, but it  doesn't add thread safety to its data. Consider
/// `Arc<`[`RefCell<T>`]`>`. [`RefCell<T>`] isn't [`Sync`], and if `Arc<T, A>` was always
/// [`Send`], `Arc<`[`RefCell<T>`]`>` would be as well. But then we'd have a problem:
/// [`RefCell<T>`] is not thread safe; it keeps track of the borrowing count using
/// non-atomic operations.
///
/// In the end, this means that you may need to pair `Arc<T, A>` with some sort of
/// [`std::sync`] type, usually [`Mutex<T>`][mutex].
///
/// ## Breaking cycles with `Weak`
///
/// The [`downgrade`][downgrade] method can be used to create a non-owning
/// [`Weak`][weak] pointer. A [`Weak`][weak] pointer can be [`upgrade`][upgrade]d
/// to an `Arc`, but this will return [`None`] if the value stored in the allocation has
/// already been dropped. In other words, `Weak` pointers do not keep the value
/// inside the allocation alive; however, they *do* keep the allocation
/// (the backing store for the value) alive.
///
/// A cycle between `Arc` pointers will never be deallocated. For this reason,
/// [`Weak`][weak] is used to break cycles. For example, a tree could have
/// strong `Arc` pointers from parent nodes to children, and [`Weak`][weak]
/// pointers from children back to their parents.
///
/// # Cloning references
///
/// Creating a new reference from an existing reference counted pointer is done using the
/// `Clone` trait implemented for [`Arc<T, A>`][arc] and [`Weak<T, A>`][weak].
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// let foo = Arc::new(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
/// // The two syntaxes below are equivalent.
/// let a = foo.clone();
/// let b = Arc::clone(&foo);
/// // a, b, and foo are all Arcs that point to the same memory location
/// ```
///
/// ## `Deref` behavior
///
/// `Arc<T, A>` automatically dereferences to `T` (via the [`Deref`][deref] trait),
/// so you can call `T`'s methods on a value of type `Arc<T, A>`. To avoid name
/// clashes with `T`'s methods, the methods of `Arc<T, A>` itself are associated
/// functions, called using function-like syntax:
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// let my_arc = Arc::new(());
///
/// Arc::downgrade(&my_arc);
/// ```
///
/// [`Weak<T, A>`][weak] does not auto-dereference to `T`, because the inner value may have
/// already been dropped.
